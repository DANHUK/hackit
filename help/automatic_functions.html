Perhaps the most powerful feature of Hack-It is Automatic Functions. All of the

basic operations, and several additional ones, can be set up to automatically

fire when windows of a certain specification appear on your system. By

specifying a window title, class, or an application file name, you can have an

window automatically modified in several ways.
      <P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="images/automatic_function_entry.png"></P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="Name">Name</A>:</B> Each Automatic
      Function must have a unique name, to distinguish it in the list of all
      functions. Enter a short, descriptive name into this field to identify
      this function.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="WindowTitle">Window Title</A>:</B> This
      field specifies the criteria for matching a window based on its title. The
      drop-down contains a list of the titles of all windows that currently
      exist on the system, to make it simpler to select a given title and create
      a criteria from it. You can also enter in any specification you wish,
      using wildcard characters. Keep in mind that part or all of a window’s
      title might change, so try to create criteria for window title that will
      work across all windows you wish to affect. For example, to make Notepad
      windows stay always-on-top, enter “* - Notepad” and select Always On
      Top from the Topmost action list.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="WindowClass">Window Class</A>: </B>Each
      window on your system is created with a named class. These classes help
      Windows identify groups of windows that behave the same way. Multiple
      windows in different applications and with different content very often
      have the same class. By matching to a window’s class, you can create an
      autofunction criteria that affects the same kind of windows wherever they
      are found. This field lets you enter criteria based on a window’s class.
      The dropdown contains a list of all window classes that currently exist on
      the system. You can use an entry in this list to build your criteria. You
      can also determine the class of a window by selecting it in the Hack-It
      Window List (the class will be displayed in the status bar) or by right
      clicking the window in the Window List and selecting Window -&gt;
      Information… The dialog presented will show the window’s class.
      Example: To make all Calculator windows start with a tray icon, enter
      “SciCalc” in the Window Class field and check the “Tray Icon”
      checkbox. Alternate: With Calculator running, find “SciCalc” in the
      list of all window classes and continue from there.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="Filename">Filename</A>:</B> All windows
      are created by applications running on your system. This field allows you
      to specify criteria based on the filename of those applications. The
      dropdown contains a list of the filenames of all applications currently
      running on the system. You can select the appropriate filename from this
      list, and possibly make modifications to it. If you know the filename, you
      can just enter it into this field directly. Matching an Automatic Function
      based on filename guarantees that all the windows created by a given
      application will be affected, and only the windows created by that
      application will be affected. It is generally used in combination with the
      other criteria, but can also be used alone. Example: To make all Hearts
      windows minimize when they are first created, enter “*MSHEARTS.EXE” in
      the Filename field and select ‘Minimize’ from the Window action list.
      Alternate: With Hearts running, select the appropriate filename from the
      Filename dropdown and continue from there.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="CaseSensitive">Case Sensitive</A>:</B>
      Criteria used for matching (Window Title, Window Class, and Filename) are
      not normally case sensitive, i.e. ‘*Notepad’, ‘*notepad’, and
      ‘*NOTEPAD’ will all match the same windows. Checking this box enforces
      case-sensitive matching for all criteria.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="WindowActions">Window Actions</A>:</B>
      Actions available in this dropdown affect the standard size and position
      of the window, allowing you to Minimize, Maximize, or Restore the window.
      A Minimized window appears only as a button on the taskbar. A Maximized
      window is the size of the desktop, and covers all other non-topmost
      windows when it is active. A Restored window floats at a given position
      and size on the desktop. It only covers windows directly beneath it when
      maximized, and can be moved and sometimes resized by the user.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="TopmostActions">Topmost Actions</A>:</B>
      These actions allow you to set whether a window is Topmost, Normal,or
      Bottommost. When windows are drawn on the screen, Bottommost windows
      always appear beneath Normal windows, which in turn always appear beneath
      Topmost windows. Looked at another way, Topmost windows are always drawn
      on top of Normal windows, which are always drawn on top of Bottommost
      windows. This ordering occurs whether a given window is active or not.
      Most windows on the system are in the Normal state. Within each group
      (Bottom windows, Normal windows, Top windows), the standard placement
      occurs (currently active window is drawn on the top of the other windows
      in the group, the second-most-recently-active window is drawn just below
      it, and so on). By selecting an action from this list, you can chang the
      topmost status of a matched window.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="VisibilityActions">Visibility Actions</A>:</B>
      The Visibility actions allow you to modify if a window is Visible or
      Hidden. Visible windows are windows that appear on the screen: on the
      desktop if they are restored or maximized; and/or as a button on the
      taskbar if they have a a taskbar icon. Minimized windows are still
      considered Visible, even though they do not appear on the desktop. Hidden
      windows do not appear in the task list, on the taskbar, or on the desktop,
      and cannot be manipulated without a tool like Hack-It. Most windows on a
      system are Hidden, since there are many, many applications running on a
      given system that never require direct user input, or don’t require user
      input at all. Selecting actions from this list allow you to make a matched
      window be Visible or Hidden automatically. It is especially useful for
      making windows that are always running on your system, but that you never
      directly interact with (such as status windows, company-mandated progams,
      banner ads associated with internet service), be hidden and remain
      out-of-sight.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="TransparencyActions">Transparency Actions</A>:</B>
      On Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems, any top-level window can be drawn
      with varying levels of Transparency. Selecting a percentage from this
      action list allows you to set a matched window to a given transparency
      level. Transparent windows are drawn so that windows beneath them can be
      partially seen, even when the window is active. This feature is very
      useful for windows that you wish to have always be visible but not block
      windows beneath them. For example, an AIM buddy list can be made Topmost
      with a 50% transparency. Now your buddy list will always be visible, but
      will not block windows beneath it. Transparency is not supported on
      earlier versions of Windows (95, 98, ME).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="PriorityActions">Priority Actions</A>:</B>
      All applications on your system run at a specific priority level, normally
      at the “Normal” priority. Actions in this list let you set a priority
      that the application associated with a matched window should run at.
      Applications are given access to the processor and key system resources
      based on their priority level. Idle is the lowest, followed by Normal,
      High, and Real-Time. Applications at the Idle priority receive the least
      amount of processor time, usually when other applications are using the
      processor. Normal is the standard priority for most applications. High
      priority applications receive more processor time and faster access to
      system resources (memory, persistant storage, sound and video), at the
      expense of lower-priority applications. On an internet server, the Web
      Server application might be given a High priority to keep it responding
      quickly to web hits. Real-Time is the highest priority, and is usually
      given only to system applications and processes. Real-Time priority
      applications are considered first for processor time and access to system
      resources, at the expense of all others. Applications which must always be
      immediately responsive or have immediate access to resources are good
      candidates for Real-Time priority.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="DestructionActions">Destruction Actions</A>:</B>
      Actions in this list allow you to instantly Close a matched window or End
      Task the window’s application. Closing a window has the same effect as
      clicking the “X” icon on the window’s title bar. For applications
      with only one window, this often terminates the application. End Tasking a
      window (really, its associated application), causes the application to be
      forcibly terminated, at the system level. Any unsaved information is lost,
      and the program stops running immediately. The Close action is useful for
      getting rid of windows that pop up at inconvenient times, such as banner
      ads or informational messages that are anything but informative. The End
      Task action is useful for terminating an application completely, as soon
      as a given window associated with the application appears on the system.
      Take care using End Task in autofunctions. Incorrect criteria could cause
      unexpected results, such as programs you didn’t intend to affect being
      terminated immediately.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="ResizeAction">Resize Action</A>:</B> This
      action allows you to specify a specific size you want a matched window to
      be set to. Most windows start out with a specific size, usually programmed
      into them. This action is useful for changing the size of windows that
      start out at an inconvenient size. The format for the size is [width] X
      [height]<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="MoveAction">Move Action</A>:</B> This
      action allows you to move a matched window to any position on the screen.
      The coordinates [horizontal], [vertical] are specified on the screen, with
      the upper-left corner being (0,0) and the lower-right corner being 640,480
      or 800,600 or 1024,768, according to your screen resolution. The window is
      positioned with its upper-left corner at the position you specify.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="SpecialActions">Special Actions</A>:</B>
      The only available Special Action, Press Button, allows you to press a
      given button matched by the Auto Entry criteria. This feature is used in
      combination with the Special Data field. Using the Press Button action,
      you can have Hack-It automatically press a specific button when a window
      appears matching your criteria. You can use the Window List to discover
      pressable buttons on any window. Example: To have Hack-It put the
      Calculator (in Scientific mode) into Hex number mode when it appears, do
      the following:</P>
      <OL STYLE="margin-top:0in" START="1" TYPE="1">
        <LI CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Enter
          “Calculator” in the Window Name field</LI>
        <LI CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Select
          “Press Button” from the Special Action dropdown</LI>
        <LI CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Enter
          “Hex” in the Special Data field</LI>
      </OL>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="SpecialData">Special Data</A>:</B> See
      Auto Entry Special Actions.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="AlternateTarget">Alternate Target</A>:</B>
      Often, you will want an Automatic Function to affect the child or parent
      of a matched window, rather than the window itself. By specifying Act On
      Child in this list, and providing the name of a child window in the Target
      Data field, you can cause the actions for this auto function to affect the
      specified child window. By specifyin Act On Parent, you can cause the
      parent of the matched window to be affected instead. You can use the
      Window List to explore child windows and discover new ways to control
      applications with Hack-It. Example: To hide the Gradients radio button in
      Calculator, do the following:</P>
      <OL STYLE="margin-top:0in" START="1" TYPE="1">
        <LI CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Enter
          “Calculator” in the Window Name field</LI>
        <LI CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Select
          “Act On Child” from the Alternate Target dropdown</LI>
        <LI CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Enter
          “Gradients” into the Target Data field</LI>
        <LI CLASS="MsoNormal" STYLE="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Select
          “Hide” from the Visibility action dropdown</LI>
      </OL>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="TargetData">Target Data</A>:</B> See Auto
      Entry Alternate Target.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="TrayIcon">Tray Icon</A>:</B> This action
      adds a tray icon to the System Tray for the matched window, and allows you
      to press the Minimize button on the window to hide it. This has the same
      effect as manually Trayying a window from the Window List. See “Trayying
      a Window” for more information.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="MatchTopLevelWindowsOnly">Match Top-Level
      Windows Only</A>:</B> For more complex Automatic Functions, you can have
      the system check child windows as well as normal top-level windows when
      applying a function. If, for example, you wished to close a child window
      with a specific class name, you would need to use this feature.</P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="OK">OK</A>:</B> Press OK to accept this
      auto function when you have completed it. It will go into effect
      immediately. You must name the auto function and specify at least one
      criteria for matching.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="Cancel">Cancel</A>:</B> Press Cancel to
      cancel adding this function, or to cancel any changes to a function you
      are editing.</TD>
