<h2 style="page-break-after:auto">Illegal Windows</h2>

<p>In the Settings dialog, the page marked “Illegal Windows” lets you

configure window specifications that will ignored by Hack-It. There are many,

many windows on a typical system at any given time, and a great deal of those

windows are not ones you will normally want to show up in the list or be able to

manipulate. Some are connected to system-critical processes that are best left

alone. By specifying them as “Illegal” you can effectively hide them from

anyone using Hack-It, to make for a safer and healthier environment.
