      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="Name">Name</A>:</B> Each Illegal Window
      specification must have a unique name, to distinguish it in the list.
      Enter a short, descriptive name in this field.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="WindowTitle">Window Title</A>:</B> This
      field specifies the criteria for ignoring a window based on its title. The
      drop-down contains a list of the titles of all windows that currently
      exist on the system, to make it simpler to select a given title and create
      a criteria from it. You can also enter in any title specification you
      wish, using wildcard characters. Keep in mind that part or all of a
      window’s title might change, so try to create criteria for window title
      that will work across all windows you wish to affect. For example, to
      ignore all Notepad windows, enter “* - Notepad” for the window title.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="WindowClass">Window Class</A>: </B>Each
      window on your system is created with a named class. These classes help
      Windows identify groups of windows that behave the same way. Multiple
      windows in different applications and with different content very often
      have the same class. By matching to a window’s class, you can create an
      Illegal Window criteria that matches the same kinds of windows wherever
      they are found. This field lets you enter criteria based on a window’s
      class. The dropdown contains a list of all window classes that currently
      exist on the system. You can use an entry in this list to build your
      criteria. You can also determine the class of a window by selecting it in
      the Hack-It Window List (the class will be displayed in the status bar) or
      by right clicking the window in the Window List and selecting Window -&gt;
      Information… The dialog presented will show the window’s class.
      Example: To ignore all Calculator windows, enter “SciCalc” in the
      Window Class field. Alternate: With Calculator running, find “SciCalc”
      in the list of all window classes.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="Filename">Filename</A>:</B> All windows
      are created by applications running on your system. This field allows you
      to specify Illegal Window criteria based on the filename of those
      applications. The dropdown contains a list of the filenames of all
      applications currently running on the system. You can select the
      appropriate filename from this list, and possibly make modifications to
      it. If you know the filename, you can just enter it into this field
      directly. Ignoring a window based on its application’s filename
      guarantees that all the windows created by a given application will be
      ignored, and only the windows created by that application will be ignored.
      It can be used with the other criteria or alone. Example: To ignore all
      Hearts windows, enter “*MSHEARTS.EXE” in the Filename field.
      Alternate: With Hearts running, select the appropriate filename from the
      Filename dropdown.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="CaseSensitiveMatching">Case Sensitive
      Matching</A>:</B> Criteria used for matching (Window Title, Window Class,
      and Filename) are not normally case sensitive, i.e. ‘*Notepad’,
      ‘*notepad’, and ‘*NOTEPAD’ will all match the same windows.
      Checking this box enforces case-sensitive matching for all criteria.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="OK">OK</A>:</B> Press OK to accept this
      Illegal Window specification when you have completed it. It will go into
      effect immediately. You must name the specification and specify at least
      one criteria for matching.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><B><A NAME="Cancel">Cancel</A>:</B> Press Cancel to
      cancel adding this specification, or to cancel any changes to a
      specification you are editing.</TD>
