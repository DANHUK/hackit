<h3><a name="whatis">What is Hack-It</a></h3>
<p>Hack-It is a window manipulation program. It allows you to manipulate any window on your system in several
different ways not normally available to you through the standard Windows user interface.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>

<h3><a name="whatthings">What do you mean? What sort of things can you do to windows?</a></h3>
<p>The major functions you can perform on windows are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>          Making a window visible or hidden</li>
  <li>Causing a window to stay on top of others or not stay on top of others&nbsp;</li>
  <li>          Adding an icon to the system tray for a window, and having that window minimize to the tray&nbsp;</li>
  <li>          Manipulating process priorities to give a window’s process more CPU time&nbsp;</li>
  <li>          Standard window functions such as restoring, minimizing, maximizing, and closing&nbsp;</li>
  <li>          Forcibly terminating a process</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the above functions, the first four are automatically added to the system menu of all top-level windows on
your system for quick and easy access. The remaining functions are available through Hack-It’s interface.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
          They all can be automated, matching a window’s title, and/or class name, and/or executable name to fire off any
of the above functions, plus a couple additional ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resize a window to a specific width and height</li>
  <li>Move a window to a specific (x, y) position on the screen</li>
  <li>Press a button on a with the specified text on a particular window</li>
  <li>Perform any of the above functions to a named child window of the matched window&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="whyuse">That sounds peachy and everything, but what good does it do me? Why should I use Hack-It?</a></h3>
<p>The functions listed above are basic to every window, and yet the powers that be feel we should not be allowed
to control them at will. Making a window stay on top, for example, is an extremely useful feature that you
ordinarily cannot access. Imagine you are working on a full screen document, but wish to have a stock ticker or
other informational window float above the active window so you can always check it at a glance. Without a
utility like Hack-It, there is no way to make this happen. Similar cases can be made for the system tray.
Windows will minimize to the system tray only of the developer of the application programmed it that way. This
results in many applications that are always open, always cluttering your taskbar.</p>
<p>The ability to automate all of these functions makes the operations transparent. A window that you want to
always float above others can be set up to do so. A window that you want to have minimize to the tray and hide
itself when it starts can be set up to do you. Only your imagination limits what you can do.</p>

<h3><a name="price">Wow, that really is something. It must cost a fortune to buy it!</a></h3>
<p>Oh ye of little faith! The price to register Hack-It is extremely reasonable, only $15. Many similar applications charge $40, $50, even $80
for a full registered version of applications that come nowhere near Hack-It in functionality and flexibility. And at the risk of sounding like an infomercial…THAT’S
NOT ALL! Where many other developers expect you to pay again and again for new versions of software, usually for features originally promised
or for bugfixes that should have been avoided, I make a simple promise to you. If you register Hack-It, you will be a registered user for life.
It’s as simple as that. No more fees, no more fuss. Any version of Hack-It that comes out – you will be entitled to a full, unfettered version of.
How’s that for a deal?</p>

<h3><a name="sitelicense">You are great and wise, oh master developer. But what if I want to distribute
Hack-It around my department/office/company?</a></h3>
<p>While I cannot offer the unlimited lifetime licensing of Hack-It for site licenses, I do have a substantially lower site license fee than most
developers of similar software – only $100 per 50 seats, with a minimum license of 50 seats. Similar software either does not offer the discounted
per-seat site license, or offers it for a much higher rate. I try to be fair in my pricing, and fair in my licensing.</p>

<h3><a name="studentrate">Do you have a lower student rate so that I might be able to afford your
program? I am a starving college student and cannot afford the $15 for your software.</a></h3>
<p>Oh please. Get a job.</p>

<h3><a name="register">Alright, I’m ready to register and get my lifetime license. What do I need to do?</a></h3>
<p>You should look at the Registration Information topic in the Hack-It Help file for any information related to
registration. Basically, you can either send me a check or money order for the required amount, or you can
register online (and watch the fat cats skim their cut off the top). All the information is in the Help file.</p>

<h3><a name="sokind">Why are you so kind to all of us windows users?</a></h3>
<p>Why? Because I love you! Seriously though, I originally wrote this program for me and a few friends who
wanted this functionality. Since I use the program myself, and my friends use the program, I feel that I have
gotten a great deal out of the development process. I couldn’t imagine charging the high rates other people do
for what is really, in the end, hobbyware.</p>
