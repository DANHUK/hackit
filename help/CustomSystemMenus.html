<h2>Custom System Menus</h2>



<p>Hack-It allows you to add certain useful actions

to the System Menu of any top-level application window. It currently supports

four different actions:</p>



<ul>



<li>

Hiding a window</li>



<li>

Making a window topmost, or making a window not topmost</li>



<li>

Adding or removing a tray icon for a window</li>



<li>

Setting the priority of the process associated with the window</li>



</ul>



<p>These options are enabled in the Settings dialog,

under the <a href="file:///C:/hackit/help/window_list_tab.html"> Window Control
tab</a>.</p>



<p>Note: Certain windows in the system, such as DOS prompts,

are not represented the same way as other windows, and do not have standard

System Menus. These windows will unfortunately not receive the custom actions.</p>
