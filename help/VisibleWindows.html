<h2>Visible Windows</h2>



<p>The Visible Windows

list show all the top-level windows on the system that you can see. Most

applications have at least one top-level visible window with many child

windows contained in it. Top-level visible windows also almost always have

an icon and a title associated with them, since they are to be the main

interface to some program. There are top-level windows that do not have

an icon nor a title, such as the Windows taskbar. These are windows that

have a custom-designed interface, and are designed to not need to report

an title or icon for windows to show in the taskbar. Hack-It can only list

the icon and title for windows that choose to let them be known.</p>

<p>If a window does not report an icon, it will be given the default Windows flag icon.</p>





<p>If a window does not report a title, it will be listed

as "&lt;no title>". All windows will display their Window Class in the

<a href="StatusBar.html">status bar</a> when selected.</p>
