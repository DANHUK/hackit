<p>Hack-It is not something I do for profit, but it does require a considerable
amount of time and money to create. Software, computer systems, books, and
education all contribute to development costs. I ask only for a very small
amount for registration, and I make a pact with you all that sweetens the deal:
register once and you will never have to register Hack-It again. I don’t
understand software companies that think they can get away with selling a new
version of a product that is essentially just an old version with a few bug
fixes and features that should have been there in the first place. My price is
still only $15 for a lifetime registration – a good deal in anyone’s book.
Full site registrations are equally reasonably priced, but unfortunately I
cannot offer the lifetime registration past version 4.0. Version 5.0 is
scheduled to be a very extensive suite of enterprise applications, that would
not fall under the original Hack-It license. You private users don’t have to
worry, however. The same functionality you currently have will be offered as a
custom-taylored version of the Hack-It Platform (name pending).</p>
<p>To permanently register yourself as a Hack-It PRO user send $15 as check or
money order to:<o:p>

<p>For situations where check or money orders are not feasible, there is now
ONLINE registration for Hack-It at the following URL. Please keep in mind that
the registration service skims a substantial portion of the registration fee off
the top for themselves, so check or money order is preferred. The address for
online registration is:<o:p>
