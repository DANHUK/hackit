<h2>The Status Bar</h2>

<p>The status bar is located at the bottom of the Hack-It
main window. It serves two purposes:
<li>Display brief help on menu options as they are highlighted</li>

<li>Display the window class name of the window selected in the <a href="WindowList.html">Window
List</a>.</li>

<p>If the item selected in the window list is not a
window, or the name of the window class cannot be determined, the status
bar will be blank.</p>

<p>The status bar is useful for creating <a href="automatic_functions.html">automatic
functions</a> - you can use it to determine the window class name of a
window, and use that class name in the automatic function. Also useful
for informational purposes is the Window
Information Dialog</p>
