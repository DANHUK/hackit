<p>Top-level windows are windows that have no parent

window. They are listed as the first level of items below the root icons

in the Window List. Top-level Window Items will normally have the icon

specified by their class information in windows, but often a top-level

window will not report an icon. In this case, it will receive a standard

"Windows flag" icon.</p>

<p>There are both visible and hidden top-level windows.

The windows you normally consider to be "application windows" are usually

top-level windows. They come in many styles and sizes, and may or may not

appear on the taskbar, but they will appear on the <A HREF="window_list.html">Window

List</A> and can be manipulated by Hack-It.</p>



<p>Selecting a top-level window item will cause its window

class name to be displayed in the task bar. Double-clicking a top-level

window item will bring the selected window to the top and activate it.

Right clicking on a top-level window item will bring up the pop-up menu

configured appropriately for the selected window.</p>



<p>Note: At times, Hack-It is not notified of windows

that no longer exist, such as when a window’s process is forcibly terminated

(end task). If a window item is selected that no longer has a valid window

associated with it, it will be deselected and removed from the list.</p>





<p><A HREF="automatic_functions.html">Automatic functions</A>

normally only affect top-level windows, to keep down the amount of processing

done for each automatic function. This is configurable in the <A HREF="settings.html">Settings</A>

dialog.</p>
