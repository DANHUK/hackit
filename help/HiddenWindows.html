<h2>Hidden Windows</h2>

<p>Hidden windows are windows that are not visible
to the user.</p>

<p>Top-level hidden windows are displayed under the Hidden
Windows item in the window list.</p>


<p>Many child windows are hidden within their parents,
either because they are not in use, or because they are used only for message
handling. Hack-It does not distinguish between hidden and visible child
windows in the window list. Hidden child windows are displayed just like
other child windows. To determine if a child window is visible or hidden,
right click its item in the window list, and look for a check mark next
to the "Visible" item.

<p class="MsoNormal">Hidden windows are often used by applications to allow
an application access to the message stream. An application cannot send
or receive messages without a window. The large majority of windows are
hidden, and are used solely for message handling purposes, but many applications
will hide their main window when not in use - like Hack-It does. Hidden
windows you are not familiar with are generally best left alone, since
they may be part of a critical system-level process.</p>

<p>Windows can be toggled from visible to hidden and
back again by using the right-click popup menu on the window list. You
can also make a top-level window hidden by selecting the "Visible" item
in the window’s system menu, when <a href="CustomSystemMenus.html">Custom
System Menus</a> are turned on.</p>
