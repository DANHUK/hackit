Information about Hack-It v4.02
----------------------------------
Changes since v4.01:
 - Console windows will now appear instantly. Autofunctions that are set up
   to respond to console windows will also fire immediately.
 - The console polling options in settings have been removed.
 - Hack-It no longer polls for console windows. They are added instantly.

Registration:
 The Shareware version of Hack-It does not save any settings, but is otherwise
 uncrippled. The PRO version saves all settings to the registry. The
 cost of registration has been dropped again, as an apology for my neglect of
 Hack-It for so long. $15 will make you a registered user for life - in other
 words, once you register, you are entitled to PRO versions of Hack-It
 forever. PAYPAL REGISTRATION IS HIGHLY PREFERRED
