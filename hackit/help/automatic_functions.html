Perhaps the most powerful feature of Hack-It is Automatic Functions. All of the
basic operations, and several additional ones, can be set up to automatically
fire when windows of a certain specification appear on your system. By
specifying a window title, class, or an application file name, you can have an
window automatically: restored, minimized, or maximized, hidden or made visible,
made topmost or not topmost, set to a particular priority, closed or end-tasked,
resized or moved, or given a tray icon. In addition, you can have an
autofunction that matches a particular window affect a child window with a
particular title, affect the parent of the matched window, or press a button
with the specified text automatically.<o:p>
