<h2 style="page-break-after:auto">Captured Menus</h2>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Hack-It can capture the Main (Window) Menu and

System Menus of any window and display them in the pop-up menu. These menus and

the options in them will affect the window they were captured from just as if

you had selected them directly.</p>

<ul>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><b>System Menu</b> - The System Menu popup exactly

    mirrors the selected window’s System (Window) Menu. Any item selected in

    this menu will perform the appropriate action on the selected window.</li>

  <li>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><b>Main Menu</b> – This popup mirrors the selected

    window’s Main Menu, if it has any. Note: Some newer menus styles have very

    specialized custom interfaces, and as such cannot be captured correctly.</li>

</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">Note: Some windows, such as the applications in

Microsoft Office 97, have floating menubars that are not standard window menus.

These menus are actually child windows, and as such will not display properly in

Hack-It. I am looking into ways to solve this problem.<o:p>
