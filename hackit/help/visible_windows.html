<p>The Visible Windows

list show all the top-level windows on the system that you can see.</p>



<p ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="images/visible_windows.png" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="300"></p>



<p>Most

applications have at least one top-level visible window with many child

windows contained in it. <A HREF="top_level_windows.html"> Top-level</A> visible windows also almost always have

an icon and a title associated with them, since they are to be the main

interface to some program. There are <A HREF="top_level_windows.html"> top-level windows</A> that do not have

an icon nor a title, such as the Windows taskbar. These are windows that

have a custom-designed interface, and are designed to not need to report

an title or icon for windows to show in the taskbar. Hack-It can only list

the icon and title for windows that choose to let them be known.</p>



<p>If a window does not report an icon, it will be given the default Windows flag icon.</p>





<p>If a window does not report a title, it will be listed

as "&lt;no title>". All windows will display their Window Class in the

<a href="StatusBar.html">status bar</a> when selected.</p>
