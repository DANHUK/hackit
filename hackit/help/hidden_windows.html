<p>Hidden windows are windows that are not visible

to the user.</p>



<p>Top-level hidden windows are displayed under the Hidden

Windows item in the window list.</p>

<p>Many child windows are hidden within their parents,

either because they are not in use, or because they are used only for message

handling. Hack-It does not distinguish between hidden and visible child

windows in the window list. Hidden child windows are displayed just like

other child windows. To determine if a child window is visible or hidden,

right click its item in the window list, and look for a check mark next

to the "Visible" item.





<p class="MsoNormal">Hidden windows are often used by applications to allow

an application access to the message stream. An application cannot send

or receive messages without a window. The large majority of windows are

hidden, and are used solely for message handling purposes, but many applications

will hide their main window when not in use - like Hack-It does. Hidden

windows you are not familiar with are generally best left alone, since

they may be part of a critical system-level process.</p>



<p>Windows can be toggled from visible to hidden and

back again by using the right-click popup menu on the window list. You

can also make a top-level window hidden by selecting the "Visible" item

in the window’s system menu, when <a href="CustomSystemMenus.html">Custom

System Menus</a> are turned on.</p>
