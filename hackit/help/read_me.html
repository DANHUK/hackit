<h2 style="page-break-after:auto">Information about Hack-It v4.0 beta 11



</h2>

<h3>Standard Request for Suggestions:



</h3>

<p>I want any and all suggestions

you guys have. This program is basically made for you, and I want it to have all

the features and information you want in it. Let me know what features you think

I should add, and any information you want to submit to the help file. It will

help my efforts immensely, and maybe get you a little credit on the side.



</p>

<h3>Request for Bug Reports:



</h3>

<p>As always, since this is a beta

(hopefully the last one) I request that you send any bug reports you have

directly to me. If something goes screwy, let me know what you were doing and

what version of Hack-It, Windows, and possibly Internet Explorer you were using

when it happened. If Hack-It crashes, try to send me the details of the error.



</p>

<p>Ok, now to the nitty-gritty of the application.



</p>

<h3>Summary of Beta 11:



</h3>

<p> Beta 10, while almost feature-complete, was not the most stable thing in the

 world. Hopefully I've managed to remedy that in this release. I have also not

 had as much time to spend on Hack-It as I would like, but that should change

 this summer. Expect some good things in the next few months.

</p>

<h4>Changes since Beta 10:

</h4>

<ul>

 <li>Better use of the STL, now that I've gotten the hang of it.

 <li>HTML Help, rather than standard WinHelp

 <li>Crash Protection, to prevent irritating crashes

 <li>Better control of window list display. The window list can be configured to

   only show windows with titles, only show parents with titles, and many other

   options

 <li>Improved list refreshing

</ul>



<h3>Known Bugs:

</h3>

<p>Note: I have not tested Hack-It under Windows95 versions other than OSR2 and have only minimally tested it

under Windows 98 (not SE).

</p>

<ul>

  <li> Hack-It will sometime not completely shut down, and will

have to be killed if this happens.</li>

  <li>

The icons in the icon list will sometimes not be correct after running for a

long period of time. This is not fatal, and is a result of a workaround to

Window's handling of Image Lists. I am looking into this problem.</li>

  <li>Autofunctions are very heavy on CPU usage. This is due to the new Wildcard

matching function, which has a considerable performance pricetag attached to it.

Using the STL string class has resulted in this reduced performance, so I will

be looking into a character array solution.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Future Feature Map:



</h3>

<h4>Hack-It v4.0:



</h4>

<p>No

more features are planned for the 4.0 line as it stands. Bug fixes and minor

changes will be included before the release. Any small additional features that

formerly existed in the 4.0 betas will likely be reinstated in the 4.1 release,

slated for Fall 99.



</p>

<h4>Hack-It v4.1:



</h4>

<p>Features from the earlier 4.0 betas that are not included in 4.0 will be added

to the 4.1 release. No new features are planned.



</p>

<h4>Hack-It v5.0:



</h4>

<p>

COM/DCOM support. Hack-It will become a COM application for v5.0, and will have

numerous plug-in and component interfaces. In addition, the core parts of

Hack-It will become a base COM component, and the UI and other pieces will

simply use this component service. *Under NT there will be a Hack-It service

that can be used at a system level to offer a new level of control over systems.



</p>

<p>

Scripting support for all window functions the system supports, using ActiveX

Scripting Engines. Currently I know of Scripting Engines for Perl, VBScript, and

JScript. These languages are far more complete than anything I might hack

together, and will suit this application better.



</p>

<p>

Plug-in support for other window functions and utilities. Hack-It will be made

into a COM component that other developers can use to add Window Manipulation

and Control (WMC) features to their applications. Hack-It will be distributed as

a core Component that handles the internals of the Hack-It architecture, along

with a sample implementation (What you see as Hack-It now).



</p>

<p>A

name change is likely. The word &quot;Hack&quot; inspires much fear,

uncertainty, and doubt, and I'm tired of recieving email asking if I can

&quot;Hack the Windows NT Kernel&quot;.



</p>

<h3>Other Future Plans:



</h3>

<ul>

  <li> Hack-It for Linux! In some form, I will be

porting many of the features of Hack-It to Linux (and possible in such a way as

to be portable across many *NIX's). Let me know what you would like to see in a

Linux port.</li>

  <li> Hack-It for WindowsCE!</li>

  <li> Hack-It 2000! If Windows2000 adds useful

functionality to Windows, then Hack-It will be right there gobbling up features.</li>

  <li> Online Registration</li>

  <li> The Hack-It Window Manipulation and Control

Platform for Windows, Linux, and beyond.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Registration:



</h2>

<p>The Shareware version of Hack-It

does not save any settings, but is otherwise uncrippled. The PRO version saves

all settings to the registry. The cost of registration has been dropped again,

as an apology for my neglect of Hack-It for so long. $15 will make you a

registered user for life - in other words, once you register, you are entitled

to PRO versions of Hack-It forever. Pretty sweet deal, don't you think?
