<h2>Child Window Items</h2>



<p>Child windows are windows in the system that have

a parent window. They appear as items at levels below the top-level items

as shown below:</p>



<p><img border="0" src="images/ChildW5.gif" width="385" height="452"></p>



<p>A child window can also be a parent to other child

windows, and this structure is reflected in the window list. If a parent

window is not visible, then generally none of the child windows are visible

either.</p>





<p>Almost every user interface item you see on the screen

is represented internally by a window. There are many times more child

windows on the system than top-level windows, since edit boxes, buttons,

lists, trees, and many other primitives are all windows.</p>



<p>Child windows can be manipulated just as top-level

windows can, but these manipulations will only take place within the child’s

parent and relative to the child’s sibling windows.</p>
