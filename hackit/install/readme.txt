Information about Hack-It v4.0 RC2
----------------------------------
Standard Request for Suggestions:
 I want any and all suggestions you guys have. This program is basically made
 for you, and I want it to have all the features and information you want in
 it. Let me know what features you think I should add, and any information you
 want to submit to the help file. It will help my efforts immensely, and maybe
 get you a little credit on the side.

Request for Bug Reports:
 As always, since this is a prerelease I request that you
 send any bug reports you have directly to me. If something goes screwy, let
 me know what you were doing and what version of Hack-It, Windows, and possibly
 Internet Explorer you were using when it happened. If Hack-It crashes, try to
 send me the details of the error.

Ok, now to the nitty-gritty of the application.

Summary of RC2:
 Beta 11 was a definite improvement over Beta 10. RC2 blows it away.
 List refreshing has been rehashed and sped up. Automatic functions run much
 faster and require fewer resources. Transparency is support in the functions,
 system menu options, and automatic functions. Illegal windows are matched
 more like automatic functions match. Stability, reliability, and performance
 are all improved.

Changes since RC1:
 - Cleaned up visual artifacts on window list settings tab
 - Reinstated threaded list refreshing
 - Improved list management-related message passing to prevent lockups
 - Improved icon querying

Known Bugs:
 - I have not tested Hack-It very much under anything othey than Windows 2000.
   I will be doing more testing under several versions of Windows before the
   full release.
 - Very very rarely, items will be added to the list with no icon at all. I
   haven't seen this happen in quite some time, so it might have been fixed
   incidentally

Future Feature Map:
Hack-It v4.0:
 - No more features are planned for the 4.0 line. The full release will occur
   sometime in September 2001. Any major fixes that take place will occur as
   minor revisions to the 4.0 version.
Hack-It v5.0:
 - COM/DCOM support. Hack-It will become a COM application for v5.0, and will
   have numerous plug-in and component interfaces. In addition, the core parts
   of Hack-It will become a base COM component, and the UI and other pieces
   will simply use this component service. *Under NT there will be a Hack-It
   service that can be used at a system level to offer a new level of control
   over systems.
 - Scripting support for all window functions the system supports, using
   ActiveX Scripting Engines. Currently I know of Scripting Engines for Perl,
   VBScript, and JScript. These languages are far more complete than anything
   I might hack together, and will suit this application better.
 - Plug-in support for other window functions and utilities. Hack-It will be
   made into a COM component that other developers can use to add Window
   Manipulation and Control (WMC) features to their applications. Hack-It will
   be distributed as a core Component that handles the internals of the
   Hack-It architecture, along with a sample implementation (What you see as
   Hack-It now).
 - A name change is likely. The word "Hack" inspires much fear, uncertainty,
   and doubt, and I'm tired of recieving email asking if I can "Hack the
   Windows NT Kernel".

Other Future Plans:
 - Hack-It for Linux! In some form, I will be porting many of the features of
   Hack-It to Linux (and possible in such a way as to be portable across
   many *NIX's). Let me know what you would like to see in a Linux port.
 - Hack-It for WindowsCE!
 - Online Registration
 - The Hack-It Window Manipulation and Control Platform for Windows, Linux,
   and beyond.

Registration:
 The Shareware version of Hack-It does not save any settings, but is otherwise
 uncrippled. The PRO version saves all settings to the registry. The
 cost of registration has been dropped again, as an apology for my neglect of
 Hack-It for so long. $15 will make you a registered user for life - in other
 words, once you register, you are entitled to PRO versions of Hack-It
 forever. Pretty sweet deal, don't you think?
